Sanity check

AdUmbrella 16.9.2017 record 67: 16/9/2017	My Talking Ben	iOS	8268	8268	16.536  (check the numbers)
Supernetwork 2017-09-15 record 73: 15/9/2017,My Talking Angela,Android,8661,8661,â‚¬8.66 (check the numbers)

Possible sanity checks: 
format of the file (with header or without)
number of clomuns
If you know a business logics, you can check the relations between numbers

Unfortunately I'm not familiar with Google Cloud, but I vote for this.
